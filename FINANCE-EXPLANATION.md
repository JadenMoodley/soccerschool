# Finance System Explanation

## Hourly Rate vs Hourly Cost - What's the Difference?

### **Hourly Rate** (What you charge)
- This is the **price per hour** you charge to the student
- Example: R200/hour means the student pays R200 for each hour of training
- This is your **revenue** - money coming in

### **Hourly Cost** (Removed - Simplified)
- Previously tracked operational costs per hour
- This has been **removed** to simplify the system
- You now only track:
  - **Hours Paid**: How many hours the student has paid for in advance
  - **Hours Used**: How many hours have been used in training
  - **Hourly Rate**: The price per hour charged

## How It Works Now

1. **Student pays in advance**: 
   - Example: Student pays for 250 hours at R200/hour = R50,000 total

2. **Track usage**:
   - As you conduct training sessions, you mark hours as "used"
   - Example: After 6 sessions (6 hours), 244 hours remain

3. **Revenue calculation**:
   - Revenue = Hours Paid × Hourly Rate
   - This shows total money received from the student

4. **Remaining balance**:
   - Remaining Hours = Hours Paid - Hours Used
   - Shows how many hours the student still has available

## Benefits of This System

✅ **Simple**: Easy to understand and use
✅ **Clear**: Shows exactly what's been paid and what's left
✅ **Flexible**: Each student can have different rates
✅ **Mobile-friendly**: Quick to update on the go

## Example Scenario

**Student: John**
- Hours Paid: 250
- Hours Used: 6
- Hourly Rate: R200

**Results:**
- Remaining: 244 hours
- Total Revenue: R50,000 (250 × R200)
- Usage: 2.4% (6/250)

This system focuses on **tracking prepaid hours** which is perfect for a soccer school where students pay in advance!
